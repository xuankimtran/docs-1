The Owner or Admin of an organization can configure a time duration after which inactive users in the organization will be logged out and redirected to the sign-in page.

On **Katalon TestOps** page, click **Settings** and choose **Organization Management**.

In **Settings**, find the **Session Timeout** section. 
The default value is 0 minute. 
* To modify, enter a number in the box. 
* To disable, enter 0 or leave the box blank. 

Click **Save** once finished.

If you enter a number, all inactive users in your organization will be logged out after the number of minutes you have determined.
