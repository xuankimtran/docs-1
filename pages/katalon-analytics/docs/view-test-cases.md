Test Case management function in **Katalon TestOps** visualizes the trends in quality over time. This allows the development teams and testers to clearly see the weak points of the software. It also enables the teams to estimate the time it takes to perform automated testing which is useful, especially when releasing critical updates. The visualizations show whether the last sprint is good or bad and to what extent.

In **Katalon TestOps**, you can view Test Cases with various types.
