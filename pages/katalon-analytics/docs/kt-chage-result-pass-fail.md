Executing scheduled jobs and uploading test results may take a while. For watching scheduled jobs and uploaded test results better, you can customize the events on which you want to receive notification emails from Katalon.

Once you have enabled TestOps integration in Katalon Studio, these settings are turned on by default. You will receive notification emails of:

* Failed test results uploaded in Katalon TestOps
* Weekly reports of your testing activities

## Turn on/off Notification Emails

1. You can turn on/off these settings in Katalon TestOps by going to **Profile** menu at the right top corner.
