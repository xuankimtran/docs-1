Behavior-driven development (BDD) is enabled in Katalon Studio. From Katalon Studio version **7.8 onwards**, you can integrate BDD-enabled Projects with Katalon TestOps.

By doing so, you can see native BDD Test Results with their Features and Scenarios.

> Requirements:
>
> * You have a BDD Project in Katalon Studio. See: [BDD Testing Framework (Cucumber integration)](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/cucumber-features-file.html).
>
> * You have enabled Katalon TestOps integration in Katalon Studio. See: [Upload Test Results to Katalon TestOps from Katalon Studio](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/katalon-analytics-beta-integration.html).
