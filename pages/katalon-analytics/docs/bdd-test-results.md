Behavior-driven development (BDD) is enabled in Katalon Studio, and from Katalon Studio version **7.8 onwards**, you can integrate BDD-enabled Projects with Katalon TestOps.

By doing so, you can see native BDD Test Results with their Features and Scenarios.

> Requirements:
>
> * You have a BDD Project in Katalon Studio. See: [BDD Testing Framework (Cucumber integration)](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/cucumber-features-file.html).
>
> * You have enabled Katalon TestOps integration in Katalon Studio. See: [Upload Test Results to Katalon TestOps from Katalon Studio](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/katalon-analytics-beta-integration.html).

### View BDD Test Results

Once you have configured BDD settings, Katalon TestOps  recognizes and processes BDD-based Test Results.

To view BDD Test Results, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Project > **Test Management** > **Requirements**.

    The **Requirements** page appears as below.

2. Scroll down to the **Requirements** section.

    You can see the Features of your BDD Tests displayed in the **Name** column (the green icon next to each Name is a *Feature* icon).

3. Click on one of the Features (e.g., **Devide**).

    You can see the Scenario of your BDD Test (the blue icon is a *Scenario* icon).

The Scenarios also appear on the **Test Runs** page (**Reports & Analytics** > **Test Runs**). This helps you capture the logic of each Test Case.

### View BDD Test Results in Traceability Matrix

In the **Reports** section on the **Requirements** page, select **Traceability Matrix** to view BDD Test Results and manage the relationships across BDD Features (**Requirements** column), BDD Scenarios (**Test Cases** column), and Defects.
