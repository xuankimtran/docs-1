## What's new in April release?
**April 26, 2021**

Katalon TestOps has been released with combined features of TestOps Core and TestOps Advanced. This release is the official version of TestOps, featuring three main points:
* Introduce PyTest integration
* Introduce Kobiton integration 
* Introduce test suite-based parallel execution

### Introduce PyTest integration 
This new feature is beneficial for the community of developers using the Python programming language. PyTest integration allows developers to:
* Upload PyTest reports to Katalon TestOps after performing tests
* Translate results from the unit and functional tests into 'codeless' reports in the centralized dashboard
* Share test results with their teams for better collaborations

### Introduce Kobiton integration 
This new feature helps Katalon Studio users who perform mobile testing using Kobition. Kobiton integration allows users to:
* Integrate TestOps with Kobiton
* Schedule and execute test runs with Kobiton devices at any time
* View mobile testing reports in Katalon TestOps

### Introduce parallel execution for test-suite level
Running test suites in sequential mode is time-consuming. You can only run one test suite at a time. TestOps 1.0 features the test suite run in parallel mode. You can run multiple test suites simultaneously. This new feature optimizes continuous testing for a faster and more efficient test cycle. Parallel execution helps: 
* Distribute multiple test suites across available test environments
* Reduce execution time
* Minimize efforts to deliver results faster
