## View Re-run Test Results

If you execute a Test Run multiple times, you can view the Re-run Test Results in that Test Run's summary and details.

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login), then go to your Project.
2. Go to **Reports** > **Test Runs**.
3. Click on the Test Run ID you want to view.
4. Select the **Test Results** tab.

You can find the Test Run's final status and its latest result here.

A re-run result has the *Re-run #* label next to its name, with *#* represents the re-run number.
