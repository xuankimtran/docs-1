On Katalon TestOps, we can change a failed Test Result of a Test Run to passed Test Result. We choose **Reports & Analytics** > **Test Runs**. Then we click to select an ID of the Test Run that we want to execute.

The Summary of Test Run displays, click and choose **Mark as Passed** at the Test Result, which we want to change from failed status to passed status.
