Katalon TestOps offers a complete presentation on traceability with **Traceability Matrix**.

You can view test cases, defects, and requirements in one central location, making it easier to manage the relationship across requirements, test cases, and defects.

In Katalon TestOps, the **Traceability Matrix** feature allows you to:
* manage your project effectively with Jira integration.
* manage Defects linked to Jira bugs for faster debugging.
* manage Test Cases linked to Jira issues to track Requirements from production through deployment.

Follow these steps:

1. Enable Jira integration. See: [Jira Settings](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-jira-config.html).

2. [Link Test Cases to Jira Requirements](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/ka-integration-jira.html).

3. [Link Test Results to Jira Defects](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/ka-defects.html). 

4. Go to **Reports & Analytics** > **Requirements** > **Traceability Matrix**.

The relationship between Test Cases, Defects and Requirements is visible on the report here.

You can map and track all Requirements in **Traceability Matrix**. It consolidates requirements and the project's results for production review.
