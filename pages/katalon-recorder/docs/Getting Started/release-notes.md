    - You can upload multiple files by separating the path with commas.
    - *Note*: It only works on Chrome as Firefox doesn't allow extensions to directly read from the file system.
    - > Help > Sample projects > **Simulate uploading files with drag and drop**.
  - You can write values to CSV files with `writeToCSV` and `appendToCSV`.
    - `writeToCSV` accepts a file name, a row number and a column name as the target where it will write the provided value to. For example: `writeToCSV | data.csv,10,first_name | Thomas`.
    - `appendToCSV` accepts a file name as the target and a string as the target. For example: `appendToCSV | data.csv | Thomas,To`

      - Read the number of lines a CSV file has.
      - Read the value at a particular row and column.
      - Compute the values from different cells in a CSV file.
    - > Help > Sample projects > **Read and use values from a CSV file**.

  - Fix an issue where You cannot export a recorded script from Katalon Recorder to Katalon Studio.


## 5.5.1.2
- Improvements
  - Promote sample projects after 1st successful execution.
    - We think these sample projects will be helpful to make users successful with their first automation script.
- Bug fixes
  - Fix an issue where switching between test cases does not reset the test case view to the top. This makes users think their data are lost.


## 5.5.1.1
- New functions
  - Add popup to ask users for their automation use cases.
- Bug fixes
  - Contextual product tips' text are unreadable on dark themes.

## 5.5.0
- New functions
  - Self-healing. [Read more](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-recorder/docs/self-healing.html)
  - Command-line runner. [Read more](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-recorder/docs/command-line-runner.html)

## 5.4.14
- New functions
  - Add popup for users to rate KR on Chrome and Firefox store.
  - Add sample projects to contextual product tips.
  - Add the ability to download data files from KR.

## 5.4.10
- Improvements
  - Improved registration process.
    - Since version 5.4.10, new users will have unlimited test executions, but can create only one automation script. To create more, a **free account** is required. 
      - We have experimented with setting quota on the number of executions, but decided that it does not align with how users experience success with the product because the number of executions required to automate a scenario successfully vary greatly. However, when you want to automate more scenarios, it likely indicates that you have succeeded in automating one scenarios.

## 5.4.6
- Improvements
  - Improved registration process.
    - Since version 5.4.6, new users will have to sign up for a **free** account after 4 successful executions. Our data has shown that users that have more than 4 successful executions are more likely to adopt the product.
- Bug fixes
  - Fixed an issue where record and playback fails on Angular forms. Users could not record `sendKey` on Angular forms, which also makes playback fail.

## 5.4.5
- Improvements
  - Improved registration process. 
    - We are constantly refining the registration process to offer users the best experience while balancing againt our business needs.
    - Since version 5.4.5, new users will be able to execute 25 tests without being forced or suggested to sign up. However, when the quota is exceeded, you will need a **free** account and log in to continue your work.

## 5.4
- New functions
  - Undo/redo mechanism to recover from mistakes while editing tests.
  - New Product Tours for both new and current KR users.
