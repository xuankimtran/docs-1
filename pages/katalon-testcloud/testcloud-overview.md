description: Introducing TestCloud and Beta Testing program for Katalon users
---

Katalon TestCloud is a **cloud-based test execution environment** where you can automate test scripts across the most common and updated browsers and/or operating systems (OS) and/or a combination of both.

TestCloud saves time and reduces the cost of creating physical infrastructure to simulate the same platforms for test automation.

TestCloud addresses the following problems:

* difficulty and inability to test across browsers and OS effectively.
* scalability issues due to expensive infrastructure and slow process in setting up physical labs.
* time-consuming configuration and integration for the test execution to work in different environments and scenarios.
* limited availability of test scenarios/devices/OS/browsers.

**No setup and maintenance required** to use TestCloud as your test environment. TestCloud is also ready to integrate with your CI/CD pipelines.

Katalon TestCloud is now integrated with Katalon TestOps. For more information, see: [Integration with TestOps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-testcloud/docs/integrate-testcloud-with-testops.html). Katalon Studio integration is under development.

From January 20, 2022, Katalon TestCloud is in General Availability Trial (GA Trial). All users who belong to a TestOps Organization can now use TestCloud for free with the **Free GA Trial** package, with the following quotas and limits:
