If you have successfully subscribed to KSE and RE via Purchase Order (PO) method, the licenses are generated and added to your account by the Katalon team.

Every Katalon license is associated with an Organization in Katalon Admin. Please follow these steps to complete the subscription process:

1. Log in to [Katalon Admin](https://admin.katalon.com/) with your registered Katalon account.
2. Create a new Organization (when creating an organization, you're automatically granted the Owner role).
3. Navigate to the newly created Organization.
4. Send the Organization's URL containing its ID and the Organization Owner's email to the Katalon team.

Once having confirmed our receipt of your Organization’s URL, we will grant the purchased licenses to your organization within 24 business hours.

For managing, creating and assigning your licenses, please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-management.html).
