Katalon TestCloud is a cloud-based test execution environment where you can automate test scripts across the most common and updated browsers and/or operating systems (OS) and/or a combination of both. See: [TestCloud Overview](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-testcloud/docs/testcloud-overview.html).

This guide shows you how to configure TestCloud integration (Beta) in Katalon Studio (KS) and execute tests/view reports with TestCloud.

> Requirements:
>
> Katalon Studio version 8.2.5 onwards.

4. Select the OS, browser, and browser version in the **Configuration** section.

    > Notes:
    >
    > * We currently only support Linux (remote OS). For browsers, we support Chrome and Firefox.
    > * The tunnel box is unchecked by default. TestCloud Tunnel is for running tests in private domains. See: [Configure TestCloud Tunnel](/katalon-studio/docs/testcloud-integration.html#configure-testcloud-tunnel).

4. Click **OK**.

## Configure TestCloud Tunnel

If you want to execute TS/TSC in private domains, you must use TestCloud Tunnel.

For detailed information on TestCloud Tunnel and how to utilize it, see [TestCloud Tunnel](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-testcloud/docs/testcloud-tunnel.html).

To configure TestCloud Tunnel, follow these steps:

1. Open the **TestCloud Configuration (Beta)** dialog.
2. Check the **Execute with Tunnel for private domain testing** box.

    You will see a message in red as follows:

     <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-testcloud/studio-integration/tunnel-setup-helper-link.png" width=50% alt="tc config dialog">

3. Click on the **Tunnel Setup Helper** link in the message.

    The **Tunnel Setup Helper** dialog appears as below.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-testcloud/studio-integration/tunnel-helper.png" width=50% alt="tunnel setup helper">

4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the dialog to set up the tunnel client in your local machine:

    * Step 1: Select your OS and download the .zip file, then unzip it.

    * Step 2: Open the command-line interface (CLI), copy the command line from the dialog, then run it in the CLI.

        > Notes for macOS users:
        >
        > If you cannot run the tunnel file, see [Unable to set up TestCloud Tunnel in macOS](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-testcloud/docs/troubleshoot-macos-workaround.html) for a troubleshoot and workaround.

         An example command looks like this:

        ```groovy
        ./kt config --tenant KatalonStudio --username "your_username" --organization-id "your_organization_id" --api-key "your_api_key"
        ```

        You have set up the tunnel client in your local machine.

    * Step 3: Copy the command in the dialog and run it in your CLI to start the tunnel.

        An example command looks like this:
        
        ```groovy
        ./kt start
        ```

        <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-testcloud/studio-integration/setup-tunnel-studio.png" width=100% alt="kt start">

    > Notes:
    >
    > Keep your CLI (cmd/terminal) open until you have finished running tests.

5. Go back to the **Tunnel Setup Helper** dialog and click **Close**.

    Once you have started the tunnel in your local machine, the **TestCloud Configuration (Beta)** dialog displays a green *Status: Available* message.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-testcloud/studio-integration/tc-config-tunnel-setup-available.png" width=50% alt="tunnel setup helper">

    > Notes:
    >
    > You can also click on the **Refresh** button to have the status updated.

6. Click **Run** to start executing TS/TSC with TestCloud Tunnel.

## View TestCloud reports

After executing tests, execution data is consolidated in logs and reports. You can view TestCloud reports in the following formats: CSV, PDF, JUnit, HTML.

See: [Test Suite and Test Suite Collection Reports](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/test-suite-report.html).

> Known issues:
>
> When executing tests via TestCloud integration and a proxy, the opening browser step might fail because of an error relevant to Transport Layer Security (TLS).
>
> A workaround for this issue is to pass through the TLS with the below domains on your server:
>
> * All the domains corresponding to this regex: `^testcloud\.katalon\.com$`.
> * The domain of the site under test.

## Troubleshoot  for closing TestCloud Tunnel
> ### Problem:
> The TC tunnel cannot be closed by clicking on X icon. If doing so, itâ€™ll continue running in the background. Instead, users need to use Ctrl+C to close a running tunnel (for the time being until the bug is fixed). 
>
> ### How to fix:
> If you have closed a TC tunnel by clicking on the **X** icon, you will not see the tunnel setup helper to input command lines into the Windows terminal.Thus, you will not be able to reconfigure the tunnel even if you want to. 
> 
> To fix this, perform the following steps:
>* Open the currently used version of the tunnel **kt.exe**, with Windows terminal.
>* Type **kt start** and hit **Enter** to run.
>
> Notes: 
> 
> As the last used tunnel's configuration is already enabled, you do not need to copy the command lines from the tunnel setup helper and can skip to the running step.
>
>* The tunnel will show a command that it is still running.
>* Click **Ctrl+C** to close it properly.

> Notes:
>
> This is a temporary fix that can be used for the time being until a proper resolution to this issue is implemented. There is no specific timeline as to when the resolution would be made available.
