Katalon Studio partially supports hybrid mobile apps. You can view the supported environments here: [Supported environments](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/supported-environments.html#mobile).

If elements of a hybrid app are rendered as in a native app, Katalon Mobile Recorder/Spy utility can capture elements. You can learn how to capture elements in Katalon Mobile Recorder/Spy utility in the following documents: 

- [Mobile Recorder Tutorials](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/mobile-recorder-tutorials.html)
- [Mobile Spy Tutorials](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/spy-mobile-utility.html)

If those elements are rendered in WebView or a Flutter-based app, which are use cases of a hybrid mobile app, Katalon Studio provides some workarounds for elements capturing in the following documents:

- [Capture elements in hybrid Android apps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/capture-elements-in-hybrid-android-apps.html)
