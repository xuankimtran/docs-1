Katalon Studio supports text encryption and set them right into the test script. This feature is useful in case of project team need to share tests that contain sensitive information with other team members or key stakeholders. There are two ways to leverage this feature in **Manual Mode** and **Scripts Mode**:

Manual Mode

* Select [**setEncryptedText**](/display/KD/%5BWebUI%5D+Set+Encrypted+Text) from the built-in keywords dropdown list. Click on **Input** field and a pop-up will be displayed to help encrypt any raw text.  
* Next, enter the raw text and select **Insert**. Katalon Studio will **automatically** encrypt and insert into the test step.
