3. Tick on the **Enable Katalon TestOps Integration** checkbox.

    Wait for Katalon Studio to connect to Katalon TestOps.
    
    Once the connection is successful, Katalon Studio retrieves all Teams and Projects from the Organization you belong to.
    
4. Choose your Team and Project in a dropdown menu of the **Team** and **Project** sections.

    If you are the Owner or Admin, you can also click **New Project** to create a new Project instead.

5. Click **Apply and Close**.

Once you have enabled Katalon TestOps integration in Katalon Studio, your Test Results are automatically uploaded to TestOps Center every time you run Test Suites in Katalon Studio.
