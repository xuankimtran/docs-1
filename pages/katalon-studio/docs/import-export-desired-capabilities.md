From v8.0, Katalon Studio allows you to import and export desired capabilities in Katalon Studio project(s). These functions support you to work with **Desired Capabilities** more efficiently and less error-prone.

### Export Desired Capabilities

1. Go to **Project/Settings/Desired Capabilities** > choose the driver that you want to export its desired capabilities.

2. Click **Export**. In the dialog box, select the destination folder to save the export file > **Save**.

    > **Note**
    > 
    > The export configuration will be saved as a **JSON file** to reduce your effort spent on modification and recreation capabilities in case you want to copy the configuration to multiple places with some minor changes.
