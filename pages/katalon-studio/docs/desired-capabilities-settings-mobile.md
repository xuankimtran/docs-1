Through using Desired Capabilities, we can communicate with Appium server by sending a POST request. For example, a user would like to run mobile test with a preferred platform, browser, orientation of the app, etc. If the user has already set the desired capability preferences setting, Appium server will start a session with the capabilities that user has set initially.

Desired capabilities is a JSON object (having keys and values pair). Within each desired capability, there are few inbuilt capabilities. We need to set the capability **name** as '**key**' and **capability** value as '**value**'. The capabilities keys are **case-sensitive**.

This article shows you how to configure some common capabilities in Mobile testing and the location of desired capabilities files.
## Set desired capabilities for Mobile testing in Katalon Studio

You need to select the device when configuring Desired Capabilities.
