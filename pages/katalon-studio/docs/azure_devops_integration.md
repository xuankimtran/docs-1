> **Important**
>
> This is just a prerelease version, not ready for production use.

In the release of version 8.0, expected to be shipped by the end of April. Katalon Studio can be natively integrated with  Azure DevOps (ADO) - Test Plans. 

> Download Katalon Studio v8.0.0.rc [here](https://github.com/katalon-studio/katalon-studio/releases/tag/v8.0.0.rc).


This feature will support you:

- When you have manual Test Cases in ADO, you want to map to a corresponding automated Test Case in Katalon Studio to know which Test Cases are automated.

- When you execute the integrated Test Cases in Katalon Studio, you want the Test Run to be created accordingly with the test execution reports and results uploaded to its corresponding Test Run in ADO so that you can get the test status and have sufficient materials for debugging.

In terms of the feature, you can do the following things:

- Enable, Authenticate and Configure the integration in Project Settings.
- Associate Test Cases between two systems.
- When a Test Suite/ Test Suite Collection execution finishes, Katalon will create Test Run and submit Test Results to ADO.
- Dynamically change test plan ID, test run name, and build number of a test run via CLI.

This document introduces how the built-in **Azure DevOps Integration** feature looks like and how to use it in Katalon Studio.

**Requirements**

* Katalon Studio version 8.0.
* An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.
* Set up Azure DevOps.

### Enable the Integration and Authenticate Azure DevOps Organization

You need to enable ADO integration and authenticate your ADO to retrieve and map test artifacts between two systems and submit test results to ADO. Do as follow:

In Katalon Studion, go to **Project > Settings > Integrations > Azure DevOps**:

1. Select **Enable Intergration** to enable **Authentication** section for editting.

2. Enter the required credentials for **Authentication**. Your credentials are encrypted by default for security.

    - **Server URL**: `https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}`
    - **Personal Access Token**: your [Personal Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page). We recommend you to create a Personal Access Token with full scope access.

3. Select **Encrypt authentication data** for security assurance.

4. Click **Connect** to verify whether Azure DevOps is connected successfully.

### Configure the Integration

After successfully authenticating with ADO, you can select an ADO project among those you have access to in the drop-down list of **Project**.

To configure the integration, do as follows:

1. Select a Project for submitting the test run.

    - Select a fetched project in the **Project** drop-down list.

    - The **Test Artifacts Mapping** and **Submission Option** fieldsets are expanded automatically. You can customize the settings in each section. 

        > Click **Fetch Project** to fetch the latest projects list.

2. Conduct Test Artifacts Mapping

    - In the **Execution Status Mapping**, map **Katalon Studio's status** with **Azure DevOps's status** to match the test results in Katalon Studio with the test outcomes in ADO.

        <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/azure-devops-intergration/status-mapping.png" width=70%>

    - In the **Test Configuration Mapping**, map the **Execution OS/Device** and **Execution Browser/App** with the **Test Configurations in Azure DevOps** to match the testing environment configured to run the tests in Katalon Studio with configurations fetched from ADO.

        You can also **Add** or **Remove** item(s) to customize the settings.

        > **What is Test Configuration?**
        >
        > **A Test Configuration is a combination of configuration variable values**. Your configuration variables could be, for example, operating system, browser, CPU type, database. A configuration might be "Windows 8 + 32-bit CPU" or "Windows 10 + 64-bit CPU." [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/test-different-configurations?view=azure-devops)

3. Configure Submission Options

    - Select a fetched test plan in the drop-down list, the test run is submitted to ADO automatically.

        > Click **Fetch Test Plans** to fetch the latest test plans list.

    - If you want to create test results for ADO test case ID when there are multiple test points returned, select **Send test results when ...** to enable test run details for editing > enter the required **Test Run Name**.
    
        > **What is Test Point?**
        > 
        > **A test point is a unique combination of a test case, test suite, configuration, and tester**. Test cases by themselves are not executable. When you add a test case to a test suite, test point(s) are generated. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/new-test-plans-page?view=azure-devops#execute-tab)

    - Decide when and what to submit test results.

4. Click **Apply and Close** to save your settings.

### Map test cases between Katalon Studio and Azure DevOps 

**In Katalon Studio:**

1. Double-click on a Test Case to open the test case view.
2. Select **Integrations** tab > specify the Test Cases ID(s) of ADO (to map to more than one ID, separate them by a comma).
3. Click **Verify** to check whether the test case id exists in ADO for mapping the test case(s) > **Save**.

### Submit test run and test results after execution

> Ensure that you have already taken the stated steps.

When the execution finishes, the test run is created, and test results are uploaded automatically to ADO in the format specified as below:

### Dynamically changing test run’s information in CLI

You can change the test plan ID, test run name, and build number of a test run by using the following command-line.

<table data-number-column="false" data-layout="default" data-autosize="false" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">
