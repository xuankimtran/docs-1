Overview
--------

> *   For the best performance, please clean up the Katalon workspace frequently. Navigate to **File** \> **Clean up**.

Features File is located within **'Include/'features'** folder from your project folder and can be seen from _Tests Explorer_:

The content of _Features_ File will follow BDD conventions (_Given, When, The_n). When creating a new _Features_ File, there will be an option to '**Generate sample Feature template**' which will generate a sample template for your _Features_ File. This will ensure that the created _Features_ File matches with BDD convention so that you will reduce efforts in creating _Features_ File in the correct format.

Let's look at an example of Katalon Demo Cura System ([http://demoaut.katalon.com).](http://demoaut.katalon.com%29./) We want to test the _Login_ feature with a valid and invalid credential so the content will be something like this:

  As a user, I want to login to Cura System
  so that I can make an appointment.

  @Valid

Maintain Features File
----------------------

> *   Katalon Studio code inspection will detect and highlight any missing _Step Definitions_ in _Features File_ to help the user create the required step definitions.

  
There will be cases the current _Features_ File meet one of the following maintenance difficulties:

*   The current format is not organized properly.
*   Figure out which _Step Definitions_ is mapped with current _Gherkin_ step.
*   Recalculate steps in the _Features_ file when there are changes in _Step Definitions_.

Above difficulties have been handled directly from the context menu of Feature File editor.

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pretty Format | Re-do the format. |
| Find Step | Find relevant step of current Gherkin step in existing Step Definitions files. |
| Recalculate steps | Recalculate steps in the Feature file when there are changes in Step Definitions. |
