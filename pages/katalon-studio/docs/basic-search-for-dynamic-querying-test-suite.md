[Dynamic Test Suite](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/dynamic-test-suite-ks.html#create-a-dynamic-test-suite) allows you to define the query search and manage query plugins from Katalon Store. [Basic Search For Dynamic Test Suite](https://store.katalon.com/product/2/Basic-Search-For-Dynamic-Test-Suite) is one of them. This plugin enables basic search capabilities to look for test cases faster in Katalon Studio and help filter which test cases to be executed.

1. Create a new dynamic test suite by a right-click on **Test Suite > New > Dynamic Test Suite**.

2. Add test cases to the dynamic test suite NOT in a manual way but via [search query](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/advanced-search.html). Enter the search condition, click **Preview** to query out the matching test cases and the total number of results.

    For example, to add the test cases in the â€œCustom-keyword samples" folder to this dynamic test suite, you can use this search query: `id=(Test Cases/Simple Examples/Katalon Shop/Custom-keyword samples)`.

    Test cases that match the search conditions are chosen when the test suites are executed (unlike in built-in test suites, test cases are chosen at planning time).
